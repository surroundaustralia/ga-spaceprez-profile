# GA SpacePrez Profile
This is an extension to the [SpacePrez data *profile*](https://w3id.org/profile/spaceprez) defined to capture additional requirements for the display of data for Geoscience Australia, in particular for HTML views.

*SpacePrez* is the spatially-configured [Prez](https://github.com/surroundaustralia/Prez/) application.

Note that most of the constraints that this profile places on data are inherited from the [SpacePrez profile](https://w3id.org/profile/spaceprez), which in turn inherits from the [OGC LDA PI Profile](https://w3id.org/profile/ogcldapi) which ensures RDF spatial data is formulated according to [GeoSPARQL 1.1](https://opengeospatial.github.io/ogc-geosparql/geosparql11/spec.html) and that it has all the elements needed for [OGC API - Features Core](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/features/) APIs.

This data profile has a persistent web address identifier:

* <https://w3id.org/profile/ga-spaceprez>
